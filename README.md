# Password Strength Checker

A Python-based tool designed to evaluate the strength of passwords. This application checks for common vulnerabilities, calculates password entropy, estimates crack time, and provides actionable feedback to help users create stronger, more secure passwords. Perfect for developers, security enthusiasts, and anyone looking to improve their password hygiene.


## Features

- Password Strength Analysis: Evaluates password strength based on length, character variety, and common patterns.
- Entropy Calculation: Measures the randomness and complexity of a password.
- Crack Time Estimation: Estimates how long it would take to brute-force the password.
- Common Password Check: Detects if the password is in a list of commonly used passwords.
- User-Friendly GUI: Built with Tkinter for easy interaction.
- Dark Mode Support: Toggle between light and dark themes for better usability.


## Purpose
The Password Strength Checker is designed to help users create stronger, more secure passwords by providing a detailed analysis of password strength. In today’s digital age, weak passwords are one of the leading causes of security breaches. This tool aims to:

- Educate Users: Help users understand what makes a password strong or weak.
- Improve Security: Encourage the use of complex, unique passwords to protect online accounts.
- Prevent Common Mistakes: Identify and flag common password vulnerabilities, such as sequential characters, repeated patterns, or the use of easily guessable words.
- Empower Developers: Provide a customizable, open-source solution for integrating password strength checks into applications.
